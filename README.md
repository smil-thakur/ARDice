# ARDice

<h1>AR Dice App<h1>
The AR Dice App is an augmented reality (AR) application that utilizes computer vision technology to detect plane surfaces and provides a virtual dice rolling experience on those surfaces. By leveraging the power of AR, the app enhances the way users interact with their surroundings, adding a fun and immersive dimension to traditional dice games.

<h5>Features<h5>
Plane Detection: The app uses advanced computer vision algorithms to identify flat surfaces in the user's environment. Once a suitable plane is detected, the app covers it with a realistic grass texture, creating an augmented reality gaming space.

Virtual Dice Rolling: Users can place virtual dice on the detected plane and roll them by tapping the screen or using intuitive gestures. The dice respond to physics-based simulations, providing a realistic rolling experience. The result of each roll is displayed, making it easy for users to keep track of their game progress.
